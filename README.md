## Notes
1. This project has been a learning experience as I had no experience with IOS Development.
2. In the **AuthManager** file, be sure to add your clientID, clientSecret, and redirectURI in which you obtain from the https://developer.spotify.com website.
3. This project still needs some work as in some cases, the audio doesn't match with the album cover, etc.
